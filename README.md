# Landing Page

This repository contains the source code for the "Landing Page" project, part of the Foundations course in The Odin Project. The main objective of this project is to practice my Flexbox skills while building a well-structured and visually appealing web page. I've incorporated personal information, inspirational quotes, and examples of my projects to serve as a foundation for my future website portfolio.

## Project Overview

This landing page is divided into several sections:
- **About Me**: A brief introduction to my background and aspirations as a fresh Computer Science graduate.
- **Projects Section**: A preview of some of my past projects, where I focus on web development and programming skills.
- **Sections from the Project Specification**: The Quote and the Sign Up section after the Projects section are from this project's requirements.

The layout and structure were built with Flexbox, enabling flexibility and responsiveness across different devices.

## Features

- **Flexbox Layout**: I used Flexbox to create flexible and responsive layouts for the page sections, ensuring that the content adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Custom CSS**: Styling was done using CSS with an emphasis on Flexbox properties, such as alignment, distribution of space, and ordering of elements.
- **Personalized Content**: Content is tailored to reflect my personal interests and career goals, making this project a step toward my future portfolio.

## Credits

- Some design ideas were inspired by The Odin Project resources and some images from Pinterest.
